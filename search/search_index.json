Second, snow coverage obscures road boundaries and landmarks, further complicating the determination of relative position. Finally, relying solely on an analog map lacks real-time positioning capabilities, unlike modern GNSS systems that provide accurate location information and navigation parameters.

The version of 2018 include the following uptades: datum transformation based on the updated ETRS89 coordinates of realisation ETRF2000 (epoch 2017.50), a new and more accurate quasi-geoid grid model.</p> <p>The recommended ETRS89 realisation is ETRF2000 at epoch 2010.50 (AGRS2010). When using RDNAPTRANS\u21222018 it is important to use this realisation and epoch, especially for the height. For applications demanding high accuracy, it is recommended to obtain the NAP height of the point of interest by levelling to nearby NAP benchmarks.</p> <p>Figure 2: Figure 1.2.2</p> <p>There are two variants for the implementation of the horizontal component of RDNAPTRANS\u21222018 and two variants for the vertical component (Figure 1.2.2).</p> <p>Implementation variant 1 applies the datum transformation as a separate step using a 3D similarity transformation. The advantage of implementation variant 1 is that it has no strict bounds for the area where horizontal coordinates can be transformed correctly. The disadvantage is that many software packages do not support implementation variant 1 for the horizontal component.</p> <p>Implementation variant 2 includes the datum transformation in the correction grid and uses a different quasi-geoid grid for the height transformation. Implementation variant 2 for the horizontal component is supported by more software but can only be used within the bounds of the correction grid (Figure 1.1.1).

With this alternative grid a bilinear interpolation of the latitude and longitude corrections (Formula 2.3.1) at the nearest grid points (Formula 2.3.2) and correction of real Bessel coordinates (Formula 3.2.1) can be applied as for a correction grid without the datum transformation, but in this case the output are ETRS89 coordinates of the point of interest instead of pseudo Bessel coordinates. These grids have the same properties as the correction grids that do not include the datum transformation (Section 2.3.1). When the datum transformation is included in the correction grid, it is not possible to use a zero correction outside the bounds of the grid. A point of interest outside the grid bounds should be transformed with the 3D similarity transformation (Section 3.3) or no value should be given at all for such point.

First, the ellipsoidal geographic Bessel coordinates of a point of interest must be converted to geocentric Cartesian Bessel coordinates (Formula 2.2.1) to be able to apply a 3D similarity transformation.

Unlike conventional use in transformations, including RDNAPTRANS\u21222008 and earlier versions of RDNAPTRANS\u2122, a fixed ellipsoidal height is used instead of the actual height of the point of interest. Points with the same latitude and longitude in RD that differ in height get exactly the same horizontal ETRS89 coordinates. This enables 2D transformation between RD and ETRS89 and straightforward implementation in software like GIS packages. However, it introduces small differences between back and forth transformation.

So the order is first rotate and then translate, instead of inversing the order to translating and rotating. As a result, the inverse transformation parameters do not only have opposite sign, but the parameters also have slightly different numbers (except for the scale difference parameter). Sometimes the differences are only apparent in the last digit. The parameters could be computed from the inverse parameters too (Section 2.2.2).</p> <p>Do not use these geocentric Cartesian ETRS89 coordinates for other purposes than RDNAPTRANS\u2122, as the use of a fixed height might be not appropriate and the actual height of the point of interest should be used.

The first concept is the determination of the position and velocity of a moving body with respect to a known reference point, sometimes known as the science of navigation. The second concept is the planning and maintenance of a course from one location to another, avoiding obstacles and collisions.</p> <p>Positioning is the determination of the position of a body and is thus a subset of navigation. However, navigation is also one of a number of applications of positioning.</p> <p>Positioning techniques may be categorized in three ways:</p> <ol> <li>real-time and postprocessed techniques. Postprocessed techniques typically determine position hours or days after the measurements are made. However, navigation requires real-time positioning, whereby the position is calculated as soon as possible after making the measurements. Real-time positioning may also be subdivided into:     1.1 continuous positioning, as required for navigation, and     1.2 instantaneous positioning for applications requiring position at a single point in time.</li> <li>whether the object of interest is fixed or movable. The positioning of fixed objects is known as static positioning, whereas the positioning of movable objects is mobile, dynamic, or kinematic positioning. Navigation thus requires mobile positioning. Velocity is needed for navigation. However, it may be derived from a rapidly updated position or using a different technique, so both types of mobile positioning are relevant.</li> <li>self-positioning and remote positioning.     3.1 Most navigation applications use self-positioning, whereby the position is calculated at the object whose position is to be determined.     3.2 In remote positioning, the position is calculated elsewhere and the cooperation of the object tracked is not necessarily required,which is useful for covert surveillance.</li> </ol> <p>A navigation system, sometimes known as a navigation aid, is a device that determines position and velocity automatically.

Thus, the user\u2019s navigation solution is the same as that of the object. The parts of the navigation system located on the object to be positioned (sometimes the entire system) are known as user equipment.</p> <p>The terms position and location are nominally interchangeable, but are normally used to denote two different concepts.</p> <ol> <li>position is expressed quantitatively as a set of numerical coordinates,</li> <li>location is expressed qualitatively, such as a city, street, building, or room.</li> </ol> <p>A navigation system will calculate a position, whereas a person, signpost, or address will describe a location.

Alternatively, more distant landmarks at known positions may be selected and their distance and/or direction from the user measured.

This low power level makes the signals susceptible to interference from other signals transmitted in the GNSS frequency range.</p> <p>If the signal is from an unintentional source, it is called interference. Interference can happen in many ways from faulty TV receivers to other non-GNSS transmitting sources leaking into the GNSS frequency bands. If it is however intentional, we call it jamming. One simple jammer can overpower GNSS signals within a large geographic area, denying a position solution and timing. Another version of interference (the above is in-band interference) is band-adjacent.

Unlike interference, spoofing is always an intentional attack.</p> <p>To protect against spoofing the same methods apply as against interference.

The following are the two primary reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Many locations are recorded as events along linear features.</li> </ul> <p>For example, locations of traffic accidents are recorded using a convention such as \"27 meters east of reference mile marker 35 along State Highway 287.\" Many sensors record conditions using measures of distance or time along the lines\u2014along pipelines, along roads, along streams, and so forth.</p> <ul> <li>Linear referencing is also used to associate multiple sets of attributes to portions of linear features without requiring that underlying lines be segmented (split) each time that attribute values change.</li> </ul> <p>For example, most road centreline feature classes are segmented where three or more road segments intersect and where the road names change.</p> <p>Figure 3: Hectometre marker</p> <p>Great examples of Linear Reference Systems are the Dutch hectometre markers. As the name suggests, Dutch hectometre markers are spaced at 100-metre intervals. In addition to showing the motorway number and location, they also bear a carriageway identifier \u2013 Li for Links (Left) and Re for Rechts (Right). The carriageways are identified as being left-hand and right-hand as viewed by somebody looking in the direction of increasing location numbers. By and large, Dutch location numbers increase as one moves away from Amsterdam, or in the case of roads that do not originate in Amsterdam, location numbers increase as one moves eastwards away from the North Sea.</p> <p>Dynamic segmentation is the process of computing the map locations of events stored and managed in an event table and displaying them on a map using route features. The term dynamic segmentation is derived from the concept that line features need not be split (in other words, segmented) each time an attribute value changes; you can dynamically locate the segment.</p> <p>Using dynamic segmentation, multiple sets of attributes can be associated with any portion of an existing linear feature independently of where it begins or ends. These attributes can be displayed, queried, edited, and analyzed without affecting the underlying linear feature's geometry.</p>"},{"location":"content/notes/crs/datum_transformations-long/","title":"Datum and Transformations","text":""},{"location":"content/notes/crs/datum_transformations-long/#datum-and-transformations","title":"Datum and Transformations","text":""},{"location":"content/notes/crs/datum_transformations-long/#transformations-and-conversions","title":"Transformations and conversions","text":"<p>The International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (EPSG) used a de facto standard instead of an ISO standard.

This enables 2D transformation between RD and ETRS89 and straightforward implementation in software like GIS packages. However, it introduces small differences between back and forth transformation.

So the order is first rotate and then translate, instead of inversing the order to translating and rotating. As a result, the inverse transformation parameters do not only have opposite sign, but the parameters also have slightly different numbers (except for the scale difference parameter).

an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person</p> <p>GDPR, Article 4(1)</p> <p>A person who's data is being processed is a 'data subject'.</p> <p>If information relates to an identified or identifiable person it is personal data.

The metadata should also be considered, as it sometimes contains even more information. For example, the metadata of a picture taken with a smartphone can contain the GPS coordinates, the date and time, the author, the camera model and the settings of the camera.</p> <p>The concept of identifiability is explained by the Recital 26 of the GDPR:</p> <p>To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means that are reasonably likely to be used, such as detection, by the controller or another person, to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To determine whether the means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the cost and time required for identification, taking into account the technology available at the time of processing and technological developments</p> <p>GDPR, Recital 26</p> <p>This approach is called the risk-based approach. Data should be considered personal data if there is a high enough risk that it can be used to identify a person with reasonable effort. It also means that non-personal data:</p> <ul> <li>Could theoretically be used to identify a person, but the risk is low enough that it is not considered personal data</li> <li>Could become personal data with technological advancements</li> </ul> <p>The form that personal data takes is not relevant to the laws that govern its usage. CCTV footage, recorded audio, pictures, DNA samples and digital communications are all examples of personal data.</p> <p>Different countries had different interpretations of the relevance of context:</p> <ul> <li>Countries adopting the context irrelevance could create classes of data that are always or never personal data, regardless of the context</li> <li>Countries adopting the context relevance instead classify (almost) all data as potentially personal data under the right circumstances</li> </ul> <p>All in all, this problem of distinguishing personal data from non-personal data must be handled as a dynamic problem.

This process is called re-identification. For example, a study conducted in 2014 by the MIT showed that it was possible to identify individuals in an anonymised dataset of credit card transactions by combining it with other datasets. Even though the dataset only contained only metadata (amounts spent, type of store, code per person), the researchers managed to extract patterns and track the spending of 1.1 million people.</p> <p>Therefore, pretending to achieve anonymisation that is permanent as erasure is utopic.

These errors of up to 25 cm with respect to Amersfoort are the result of the lower accuracy of the measuring instruments at the time. By modeling the errors instead of correcting them, the RD coordinates remained the same, so that geographic files and maps did not have to be adjusted.</p> <p>Implications of Not Using Correction Grid: The correction grid is designed to correct for the historical errors in the original RD measurements (1888\u20131928), which can propagate if not addressed. Without the grid, the transformed coordinates will deviate from the true RD coordinates as much as 0.25m.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the disadvantages of sticking to the Dutch Rijksdriehoeksstelsel as the default reference system?</p> No idea?Answer <p>Change tab to see an answer.</p> <ul> <li>International Incompatibility: RD is a national system and not directly compatible with international systems like ETRS89 or WGS 84. This hinders data sharing and integration across borders.</li> <li>Grid Limitations: The correction grids used in RDNAPTRANS\u2122 have bounds, with decreasing accuracy and undefined corrections outside of these bounds.</li> </ul> <p>In 2013 the Dutch Kadaster started a project to investigate the pros and cons (for and against) of the transition to ETRS89-based storage, transfer, and analyses of the Dutch key-registers, abandoning the RD(x,y) Rijksdriehoeksstelsel projection and coordinates.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the arguments for and against transitioning to ETRS89-based storage and analysis?</p> No idea?Answer <p>Change tab to see an answer.</p> <p>Pros: - Integrity with the European system, ETRS89 is the official  reference system of the Netherlands  - The falsely conversion of RD/ETRS89 can be prevented (current RDNAPTRANS procedure not supported by most GIS packages, resulting in unnecessary errors and complications) - RD is not consistent outside the correction grid / outside the Netherlands, gradual fade-out improves this but still.  - The older Bessel ellipsoid, established through triangulation, defines different longitudes and latitudes than satellite-based datums. </p> <p>Cons: - calculations (for example computing an area) are easier in the Cartesian system than in latitude longitude  - most of the current maps are in RD, many one time costs (conversion/ updating of RD is undesirable for map users)  - Netherlands doesn't fit in a single ETRS89 zone</p> <p>The survey company \u2018Geomaat\u2019 claims they should use the so-called RDNAPTRANS procedure to obtain an accurate height profile for this \u2018truly flat and straight road\u2019. The RDNAPTRANS procedure (Figure 3) connects ETRS89 and the Dutch height system NAP (Normaal Amsterdams Peil / Amsterdam Ordnance Datum) through the so-called geoid.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Do you agree? Discuss by describing / depicting: The possibility to obtain the required cm-accuracy of a height profile by GPS measurements. The geoid in relation to levelled (orthometric) NAP-height and GPS (ellipsoidal) height.</p> No idea?Answer <p>Change tab to see an answer.</p> <p>Agree. With the help of technologies like RTK or PPP_RTK, it's highly possible that we get a cm-dm accuracy.  </p> <p>To transform between ellipsoidal ETRS89 heights and NAP heights, a quasi-geoid model, specifically NLGEO2018 is used. - NAP is a physical height system, where heights are measured relative to the geoid. - GPS/GNSS, on the other hand, provides ellipsoidal heights.  </p> <p>Figure 2: geoid and heights</p>"},{"location":"content/questions/RDNAPTRANS/#gps-and-rdnaptrans","title":"GPS and RDNAPTRANS","text":"<p>Question</p> <p>How did the GPS base network help study systematic errors in the RD system?</p> No idea?Answer <p>Change tab to see an answer.</p> <p>GPS base network provided highly accurate ETRS89 coordinates across the country. By comparing the RD coordinates of points with their ETRS89 coordinates (derived from GPS), systematic errors in the RD system could be identified, including: - Distortions caused by the original triangulation methods used to establish the RD system. - Local deviations due to historical measurement inaccuracies.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Why were systematic errors in the RD system not a problem before GPS?</p> No idea?Answer <p>Change tab to see an answer.</p> <p>Local Use of the RD System: - The RD system was primarily used for local mapping and surveying within the Netherlands. - For local applications, the systematic errors were small enough to be negligible, and the system was sufficiently accurate.</p> <p>Limited Need for Global Compatibility: - Before the widespread use of GPS, there was no need to align the RD system with global or European reference systems like ETRS89. - The RD system worked well in isolation for national purposes.</p> <p>Manual Surveying Techniques: - Traditional surveying techniques (e.g., triangulation) were less precise than GPS, so the systematic errors were not easily detectable or significant enough to cause issues.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>One could argue that first order levelling campaigns to maintain the NAP (Normal Amsterdams Peil) are obsolete because GPS/GNSS could replace these kind of measurements. Give two reasons why this change in measuring method had not taken place.</p> No idea?Answer <p>Change tab to see an answer.</p> <p>Two key reasons: - Accuracy and Reliability: The documentation indicates that ellipsoidal heights in ETRS89, as obtained by GNSS, are less precise than NAP heights obtained by leveling to nearby NAP benchmarks. Although GNSS measurements can provide accurate horizontal positions, they do not directly measure physical heights relative to a defined datum like NAP.  - By Definition of NAP: The definition of NAP is maintained by published heights of height benchmarks. These benchmarks are established and maintained through precise leveling campaigns. NAP is not defined by GNSS measurements but by a network of physical benchmarks.</p>"},{"location":"content/questions/RDNAPTRANS/#map-projection","title":"Map Projection","text":"<p>Question</p> <p>Map projections can be grouped in three classes (besides the miscellaneous projections) depending on the nature of the projection surface.
